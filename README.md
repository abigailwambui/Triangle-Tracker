Abigail Wambui created this application after a week of studying Javascript at Moringa School. This is her second week of exposure to programming.

------------------:|-----------------------------------------:|----------------------:|
All sides are equal| Sidea=Sideb=sidec                        |  Equilateral triangle |
Two sides are equal| Sidea=Sideb or sideb=sidec or sidea=sidec| Isoceles triangle     |
No side is equal   | Sidea!=sideb!=sidec                      | Scalene triangle      |
